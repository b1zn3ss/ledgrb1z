/**
 * RLS PILOT — see docs/rls-pilot.md. Wired into every call site that touches
 * `transactions` (the only table with RLS enabled so far). Still inert in
 * any deployment where the app connects as a superuser/BYPASSRLS role —
 * see docs/rls-pilot.md for the role-separation prerequisite.
 *
 * Runs `work` inside a Postgres transaction with `app.household_id` set via
 * SET LOCAL, so the household_isolation RLS policy on `transactions` (and,
 * eventually, the other household-scoped tables) can enforce isolation at
 * the database layer instead of relying on every call site remembering to
 * filter by householdId.
 *
 * SET LOCAL is transaction-scoped, not connection-scoped — it's reset on
 * COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so it's safe to use with a pooled connection: two
 * requests can never observe each other's household_id, even if pg reuses
 * the same underlying connection for both.
 *
 * This only matters if the DB role the app connects as lacks BYPASSRLS
 * (superusers, and roles with BYPASSRLS, skip RLS entirely). See
 * docs/rls-pilot.md for the role-separation prerequisite.
